# SpaceX Falcon 9 Launch Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launches to predict first-stage landing success. By determining landing outcome predictability, we can estimate the cost of a launch. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches at $62 million, significantly less than other providers (which cost upward of $165 million) primarily because SpaceX can reuse the first stage.

## Repository Contents
